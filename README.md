# Configuration
This configuration runs under Ubuntu 20.04 with [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3).

## Theme
I use the [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com), system-wide (using `lxappearance`), for the terminal and for various applications (Atom, Firefox,...).

## Terminal
I use the Z-shell with `oh-my-zsh` and the `powerlevel10k` theme.

## Wallpaper
- [img1](config/i3/img/img1.jpg) comes from one of the top post on r/EarthPorn.

## Some nice stuff
- Terminal-based activity monitor: [gotop](https://github.com/xxxserxxx/gotop)
- Mirror iOS screen
  - [RPiPlay](https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay)
  - [UxPlay](https://github.com/antimof/UxPlay) -- an alternative using gstreamer. It should be integrated in RPiPlay, but in case the aforementioned does not work...
